HIGHT (high security and light weight)
A new block cipher which is suitable for low-cost, low-power, and ultra-light implementation.
HIGHT has a 32-round iterative structure which is a variant of generalized Feistel network.
This performance is much faster than those of recently proposed low-resource hardware implementations of AES.
In case of 8-bit oriented software implementation, HIGHT is far faster than AES.
